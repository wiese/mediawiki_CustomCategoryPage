h1. CustomCategoryPage extension for MediaWiki

h2. Installation

* Download the files and and place them under **$IP/extensions/CustomCategoryPage**
* Add **require_once("$IP/extensions/CustomCategoryPage/hooks.php");** to the end of LocalSettings.php

h2. Usage


On category pages you can now use the newly added "magic word":http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Help:Magic_words **\_\_CUSTOM_CATEGORY_PAGE\_\_**
in order to turn off rendering of the list of pages in this category. From there on its up to you to make sure the page displays what it should, in a way you like.

h2. Remarks

Using the magic word will not suppress the native page listing in preview mode. This is "known behaviour":http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Hooks/CategoryPageView#Notes
